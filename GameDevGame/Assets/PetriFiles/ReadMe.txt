Some improvements made 20.9. (See PETRIFILES-FOLDER for files and scene):

- Rotation issue: if you first rotate eg. 180 degrees, and then start rotate, it is messed up. I fixed it by using a temporary handle for rotation.

- Changed rotation so that player is rotating the camera around the planet, not just the planet with static camera. That way the whole universe (background) rotates also.

- Added simple space skybox (to see the rotation of background)

- Added simple texture for planet (to see the rotation)

- Added simple turret (just to see the rotation of the gameobject)
